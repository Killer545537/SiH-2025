# Problem Statement

Youth applying to the PM Internship Scheme often struggle to identify suitable internships due to limited digital exposure, lack of prior experience, and hundreds of scattered listings. This leads to misaligned applications and missed opportunities. The challenge is to build a lightweight, AI-assisted recommendation system that, based on a candidate’s education, skills, interests, and location preferences, suggests the top 3–5 most relevant internships in a simple, mobile-friendly, and accessible format.
