# Resume Intelligence & Internship Recommender

A lightweight, AI-assisted recommendation system for matching student resumes to the **most relevant internships**.  
The pipeline parses raw resumes into structured data, encodes skills/experience into embeddings, and ranks opportunities using **CatBoost** and **transformer-based semantic models**.  

This repository is structured as a small monorepo with two services:

- **parser**: Python service for resume parsing and feature extraction.  
- **recommender**: Python service for embedding, indexing, and ranking using CatBoost + FAISS.  
- **web** (optional demo): Streamlit app for interactive recommendations.

## üìù Overview

- **Resume Parsing:** Converts PDFs/DOCs into structured JSON (skills, education, projects, experience).  
- **Embeddings:** Sentence-Transformers (BGE/GTE) encode both resumes and internship postings into dense vectors.  
- **Indexing:** FAISS ANN index supports efficient top-k retrieval at scale.  
- **Ranking:** CatBoost uses structured + semantic features (skills overlap, embedding similarity, recency) to rank postings.  
- **Deployment:** Both services run via Docker Compose. A web demo is provided via Streamlit for quick testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stack and Components

### Parser Service
- **Language:** Python 3.11  
- **Libraries:** spaCy, PyResparser, regex  
- **Purpose:** Extract candidate metadata into structured JSON.  

### Recommender Service
- **Language:** Python 3.11  
- **Embedding Models:** HuggingFace Transformers (BGE/GTE family for free + lightweight inference)  
- **Indexing:** FAISS (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)  
- **Ranking Model:** CatBoost (handles categorical + numerical features, avoids overfitting, scales well)  
- **Serving:** FastAPI + Uvicorn
